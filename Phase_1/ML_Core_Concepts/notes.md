### Day-1 Foundations of AI and ML

#### What is AI?
- It is the science of making machine think and act like humans.
- Example: Netflix recommending movies based on your viewing history

#### What is ML?
- It is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn pattern from data and make predictions or decisions
without being explicitly programmed.
- Instead of writing rules, we give the machine a set of examples and ask it to learn the patterns from them.
- Example: Spam filter, predicting the next email based on the previous ones

#### Classic ML Workflow
1. Collect data
2. Train the model on the data
3. Evaluate the model using unseen data
4. Use the model in real-world applications
