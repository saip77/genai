### 🐍 venv vs pipenv vs poetry

These are all tools used to:

*   🧪 Create virtual environments
*   📦 Manage project dependencies (libraries your project needs)

#### 🔹 1. venv (built-in Python virtual environment)

🧠 **What is it?**
`venv` is built into Python (since version 3.3+).

It creates an isolated environment so you can install packages without affecting your system Python.

✅ **Pros:**
*   ✅ Comes with Python — no installation needed
*   ✅ Lightweight and simple
*   ✅ Works anywhere (Windows, macOS, Linux)

❌ **Cons:**
*   ❌ Doesn't manage dependencies automatically
*   ❌ No `Pipfile` or `pyproject.toml`
*   ❌ You install packages manually with `pip`

📦 **Example:**
```bash
python -m venv myenv      # Create environment
source myenv/bin/activate # Activate (Linux/macOS)
myenv\Scripts\activate    # Activate (Windows)
pip install requests      # Install packages
```
🔐 Good for simple projects or when you want full manual control.

#### 🔹 2. pipenv (pip + venv + dependency manager)

🧠 **What is it?**
Combines `pip` and `venv` into one tool.

Manages:

*   ✅ Virtual environment
*   ✅ Dependencies (with `Pipfile` & `Pipfile.lock`)

✅ **Pros:**
*   ✅ Easier to use than plain `venv`
*   ✅ Automatically creates virtual environments
*   ✅ Tracks exact versions (with lockfile)
*   ✅ Built-in `pipenv install`, `pipenv shell`, `pipenv run`

❌ **Cons:**
*   ❌ Slower than others
*   ❌ Development has slowed down (less active maintenance)
*   ❌ Less flexible than Poetry

📦 **Example:**
```bash
pipenv install requests     # Creates env + installs package
pipenv shell                # Activates environment
pipenv install pytest --dev # Dev dependencies
```
🛠 Good for people coming from Node.js/npm, as it's similar to `package.json`.

#### 🔹 3. Poetry (modern Python packaging tool)

🧠 **What is it?**
A modern tool to:

*   ✅ Create and manage virtual environments
*   ✅ Handle dependencies
*   ✅ Build and publish packages

Uses `pyproject.toml` (standard for modern Python projects)

✅ **Pros:**
*   ✅ Clean, modern, all-in-one tool
*   ✅ Lockfile ensures reproducible installs
*   ✅ Great for package publishing
*   ✅ Actively maintained and widely used

❌ **Cons:**
*   ❌ Requires installation (`pip install poetry`)
*   ❌ More complex than `venv` for very small projects

📦 **Example:**
```bash
poetry new myproject        # Creates a new project with structure
cd myproject
poetry add requests         # Installs package and updates pyproject.toml
poetry shell                # Activates the environment
```
🌟 Great for serious projects, teams, or if you want to publish packages.
