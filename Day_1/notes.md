### Day 1

#### Understanding LLMs
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model
- LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data to generate human-like text
- LLMs can generate text, answer questions, and perform various other tasks

#### LLM vs NLP
- NLP is a field of AI that focuses on enabling machines to understand and process human language
- NLP techniques are used to extract meaning from text, classify text into categories, and perform other tasks
- LLMs are a type of NLP model that can generate text based on input prompts

#### LLM vs SLM
- SLM is a language model like LLM, but with fewer parameters and trained on a smaller dataset
- SLMs are often used for tasks that require fast response times, such as chatbots and voice assistants
- LLMs are large powerful models (typically 1B+ parameters) that require cloud compute, GPUs, and large memory.

#### When to use LLMs and when to use SLMs
- LLMs are best suited for tasks that require high-level understanding, such as language translation, text summarization, and question-answering.
- SLMs are best suited for tasks that require fast response times, and for privacy-sensitive applications.
